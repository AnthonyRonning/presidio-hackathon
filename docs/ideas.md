# Ideas for the hackathon

1. LLM Agent based Lightning Payer

Allow an LLM to have access to `create_invoice` and/or `pay_invoice` tool calls, ideally running in a secure enclave and interfacing with OpenSecret's enclave server and enclave LLM too.

Some user facing ideas: 
- Users can fund and create a "job" or "task" that allows people to submit potential requirements that fulfill that task along with an invoice. If an LLM decides that it's worthy of a payout then it will pay from the funder's wallet. 

2. Confidential LLM as a judge

bounties, prediciton markets, tagging training data

3. Paid Training Data Platform

(farming out data annotation tasks)

users to share their data for ai model training with rewards paid in bitcoin

Need to research this. 

4. Atonomous agents

Self replicating agents. 

4. Money bot

5. Agent vs agents

Spy vs spy, would need to figure out what they are "attacking"

agents collecting the loot, bobbie traps cost money but they get more money as a result for getting the traps

audeince can fund an agent


# Rules

Goal: always have at least one of you always alive

# Tools

Actions
- High five (if both high five, + points, if only one, minus points for that one).
- Block (costs points, gets more points back if it successfully blocks).
- Attack (hurts other player, gets some of their points, if blocked, hurts them even more).
- Do nothing (no points lost unless attacked, or three turns in a row where they did nothing so they lose points)
- beg (optional message) - user decides whether or not they get points
- kill yourself (lose all points instantly)
- Replicate available if you have enough points, you get an additional character on your team with two actions per turn now.

potential: buying a shield (costs a lot but now allows them to block)
potential: revives at full health but it costs 50% more
