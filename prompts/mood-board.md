I am taking your suggestions and putting in my opinions. Help me refine the prompt.

Below is a breakdown of the design elements you may want to consider, followed by an example prompt you could use with a visual generation AI to help you create a cohesive mood board.

---

## **1. Scene Backgrounds**

* **Setting / Environment Theme**: Futuristic city, San Francisco but futuristic in a utopian way.
* **Visual Style**: Style is similar to the Eve bot from Wall-E. Do not break copyright rules, but make the bots with similar polish and design aspects.
* **Color Palette**: Use contrasting color schemes to match the “dueling” theme—we like the Tron color schemes and Eve from Wall-E.

## **2. Main Characters**

* **Silhouettes and Shape Language**: Two AI bots that are visually distinct. Perhaps one is sleek and angular, while the other is more round or “boxy.” The difference in shape can convey different personalities.
* **Color Differentiation**: Suggest two colors, but I don't want Red vs Blue.
* **Styling Details**: Decide on facial expressions, if any. The bots have faces like the Eve bot on Wall-E where they have two digital dots for eyes that can change shape. by default the eyes are the only facial element, but it can have a smile or frown when needing to temporarily display emotion.
* **Animation Considerations**: If they’ll move in comedic ways, keep that in mind when designing limbs or features.
* **Example**: I attached an example of the design style that we want for our robot. We'd like it to look similar to this is aspect ratio, limbs, head size, facial features,
* **Likable**: the two robots should be visually appealing to humans. people should form an emotional attachment because during the game they will have the ability to send gifts to the robot to help it fight and survive. we need to strike the right balance of the robot being likable while still being strong and tough. if it is too nice, humans will feel sad watching it get beat up.

## **3. On-Screen HUD / UI Elements**

* **Player Status**: Health bars, special ability meters, or energy gauges. Make them thematic—maybe a glowing “battery” icon for each AI bot. The health in the game will actually be a money balance. The life force of the bots will be Bitcoin. When they run out of Bitcoin they die. The health status should take that into consideration
* **Text/Dialogue Display**: Chat bubbles, futuristic consoles, or a “glitchy” text box design that reflects an AI aesthetic. Come up with one that fits with the design described in the rest of this prompt.
* **Score/Timer**: Not needed
* **Minimal vs. Detailed**: UI is minimalistic future tech vibe.

## **4. Additional Considerations**

* **Logo / Title Treatments**: Put a place for the title to be on the screen, but not take up too much space
* **Transitions / Animations**: This will not have smooth graphics. It will be a few static image states that change abruptly.
* **Tone and Mood**: Lean into the robot style that I gave you having a friendly fight in a futuristic San Francisco. No graphic violence will be involved, it will be light-hearted play fighting between two bots

Refined Mood Board Prompt
Prompt:
“Mood board for a light-hearted, futuristic robot duel set in a utopian San Francisco skyline inspired by Tron-like neon accents. Show two distinct AI robot characters with a glossy, polished finish reminiscent of a beloved cinematic robot design—one is sleek and angular, the other more rounded and boxy.
Both robots have large, expressive digital eyes (like glowing dots) capable of displaying simple emotions (e.g., smiles or frowns). Convey that they are likable and evoke empathy from the audience while still appearing sturdy enough for a friendly face-off. Avoid using red vs. blue; instead, use two contrasting neon color schemes (for example, cyan and magenta) that pop against a sleek, minimalistic backdrop.
The environment is a bright, futuristic San Francisco cityscape with clean lines, shining skyscrapers, and a utopian vibe. Include references to a minimal, futuristic UI where the ‘health bar’ is represented by a glowing Bitcoin meter—this is the robots’ life force. Incorporate glitchy, playful text boxes for dialogue, but keep the overall interface minimalistic and tech-inspired.
Emphasize that no graphic violence is involved—this is comedic play-fighting between two bots. Incorporate a placeholder for a small game title/ logo placement. Showcase abrupt transitions or static image states rather than smooth animations. Arrange all these elements—robot designs, city background, UI mockups, and color palette—in a cohesive collage that highlights a charming, amusing tone with a balance of futuristic polish and fun, upbeat energy.”
