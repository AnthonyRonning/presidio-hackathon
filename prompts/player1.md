Create a humanoid robot in a neutral standing pose, designed in a retro-futuristic, neon art style inspired by Tron and Eve from WALL·E. The robot should have a smooth, polished silhouette with rounded features and segmented panel armor that suggests agility and friendliness. Its limbs are long and slender, with softly angular joints and minimalist contour lines.

The robot’s body is primarily deep black or dark teal, accented with glowing cyan panel edges and linework. The head is rounded and helmet-like, with a glossy black faceplate displaying large, softly glowing cyan eyes—expressive but neutral. Its stance is relaxed and confident: feet shoulder-width apart, arms gently bent at the sides.

Keep the design clean and uncluttered—no weapons or gadgets. The visual style should be flat-vector or cell-shaded, with bright neon edge glow and crisp shapes. Background should be dark or minimal to highlight the robot. This version should appear likable and slightly emotive, like a friendly futuristic scout or helper.
