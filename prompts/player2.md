Create a rounded, boxy humanoid robot in a neutral standing pose, designed in a glowing neon retro-futuristic style inspired by Tron and the polished softness of Eve from WALL·E. The robot has a slightly tall, sturdy build—solid but not pudgy—with pill-shaped limbs, soft-edged joints, and a smooth rectangular torso. Its overall form should feel durable, friendly, and subtly athletic, like a playful tank with personality.

The robot’s color scheme features glowing magenta highlights against deep plum or navy base panels. Its face is a curved, glossy screen with two large, magenta digital eyes set to a neutral expression—no smile or frown. Arms hang naturally at its sides; legs are straight but relaxed. The design language is simple, clean, and silhouette-friendly.

Avoid all accessories, weapons, text, or UI elements—this is a base character render for future animation or variation.

Render in a flat-vector art style with crisp glowing outlines, soft reflections, and subtle inner glows to suggest polish and depth. Lighting should emphasize contrast and neon accents. Background should be minimal, dark, and unobtrusive.
